# Latent Diffusion Large Files Repository

This repository contains large model checkpoints and weight files required for the main research project:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Latent Diffusion Models Research](https://github.com/Akii017/latent_diffusion_research)

Due to GitHub LFS storage and bandwidth limitations, these files are hosted here separately.

## ðŸ”„ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akii017/Latent_Diffusion_Large_Files.git
```

### 2. Copy Model Files to Main Project

Replace `<path-to-main-repo>` with your actual project path:

```bash
cp -r Latent_Diffusion_Large_Files/sd_checkpoints <path-to-main-repo>/models/
cp -r Latent_Diffusion_Large_Files/controlnet <path-to-main-repo>/models/
```

### âœ… Expected Directory Structure

```plaintext
latent_diffusion_research/
â””â”€â”€ models/
    â”œâ”€â”€ sd_checkpoints/
    â””â”€â”€ controlnet/
```

Alternatively, you can use the script `scripts/download_models.py` provided in the main repo to automate model downloading and placement.

## ðŸ“Œ Why a Separate Repo?

Due to GitHub LFS limitations, large binaries are kept in this dedicated repository to:

- âœ… Avoid LFS quota issues and overage errors
- ðŸš€ Improve cloning speed of the main repo
- ðŸ§© Maintain modularity and cleaner version control
- ðŸ”„ Allow separate updates to large models without impacting core research code
